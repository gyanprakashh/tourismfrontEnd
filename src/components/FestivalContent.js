      text1: `An annual pilgrimage is taken up by the followers of Lord Shiva in North India during the rainy months of Shravan (i.e. July and August) to fetch holy waters of River Ganga from several places including Haridwar, Gaumukh and Gangotri. The pilgrimage is called kānvad Yatra. The word kānvad stands a single pole (usually made of bamboo) with two roughly equal loads fastened or dangling from opposite ends. The kānvad is carried by balancing the middle of the pole on one or both shoulders `,
      text2: `The Yatra has gained immense popularity since the 1990’s and almost a hundred lakh saffron-clad kānvadiyas reach Haridwar. While the most pilgrims are males, young women have also started participating in the yatra lately.`

      text1: `The Uttarayani Fair is generally held in the second week of January every year on the holy occasion of Makar Sankranti. It is celebrated at a number of places in Uttarakhand including Bageshwar, Ranibagh and Hanseshwar though the biggest of them historically has been the Bageshwar Fair. The grounds of the sacred Bagnath temple, on the banks of River Saryu, become the venue for the fair. The fair goes on for a week.`,
      text2: `This fair also provided an important social and political platform to people.Historically the Bageshwar Fair has played an even more prominent role in trying to uproot the British evil of bonded labor or coolie begar. In the year 1921 under the leadership of Pandit Badri Dutt Pande, the official registers of the Coolies were hurled into the river, thus bringing an end to almost hundred years of a despicable tradition begun by the British rulers. Impressed by this event, Mahatma Gandhi himself visited the Bageshwar Fair in 1921.`

      text1:`Devidhura Temple in Champawat is known for the event of Devi Dhura Festival during RakshaBandhan where people gather and stones are pelted between one gathering to other who shield themselves. Amid this celebration, known as Bagwal, two gatherings of moving and singing individuals toss stones at one another, while they protect themselves with the assistance of huge wooden shields. People don’t care about the wounds and they are considered favourable. In 2013, Uttarakhand high court intervened that the stones are to be replaced with Flowers and fruits`,
      text2: `The organising committee of this festival ensures that there will be no stone pelting but only organic products and blooms will be used so Bagwal could be played with no wounds.`
