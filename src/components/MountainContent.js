      text1: `An annual pilgrimage is taken up by the followers of Lord Shiva in North India during the rainy months of Shravan (i.e. July and August) to fetch holy waters of River Ganga from several places including Haridwar, Gaumukh and Gangotri. The pilgrimage is called kānvad Yatra. The word kānvad stands a single pole (usually made of bamboo) with two roughly equal loads fastened or dangling from opposite ends. The kānvad is carried by balancing the middle of the pole on one or both shoulders `,
      text2: `The Yatra has gained immense popularity since the 1990’s and almost a hundred lakh saffron-clad kānvadiyas reach Haridwar. While the most pilgrims are males, young women have also started participating in the yatra lately.`

      text1: `Named after the trident of Lord Shiva, Trishul is the group of three imposing peaks of western Kumaon near the Bageshwar district. The main peak, Trishul I, is notable for being the first peak over 7,122 metres to have ever been climbed way back in 1907. Trishul II and Trishul III were first climbed in 1960 by a Yugoslav team from the Bidalgwar Glacier, scaling the supreme heights of Trishul II from the southern ridge and Trishul III from the northern ridge.`,
      text2: `Before ski tourism gained popularity as a winter sport in Auli, Trishul was amongst the few peaks that were used as training spots for ski-equipped patrolling officers of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police Force. It is reported that an expedition to scale the peak in 1958 took the mountaineers four whole days to climb and a mere 90 minutes to ski down to their base camp. .`
